# Changelogs #

There are a couple of ways to access changelogs.

## Issue Tracker ##

The changes that constitute each release are found in the ["Releases" section of Lucee's issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/wiki/Changelogs).
Lucee Admin

(Note: This is also described in [Update](https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/wiki/Update).)

If you already have Lucee installed, a "custom" changelog may be generated from the Lucee Server administrator (e.g., [http://your.local.site/lucee/admin/server.cfm](http://your.local.site/lucee/admin/server.cfm)). (It's "custom" because it shows you the changes, starting from your revision and ending with the eligible revision.)

   * ```Properties``` > ```Update Provider```: Choose the desired provider. (E.g., choose the ```Development releases``` option, if you want to see the changelog for the Bleeding Edge.)
   * Click the "Update" button. (This doesn't execute the upgrade, so don't worry.)
